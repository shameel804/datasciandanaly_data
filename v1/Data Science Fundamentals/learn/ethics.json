Justice\nEnsure fair distribution of benefits and burdens\n\n### 5. Explicability\nMake decisions understandable\n\n## Ethical Questions to Ask\n\n| Stage | Question |\n|-------|----------|\n| Collection | Should we collect this data? |\n| Analysis | Could findings harm anyone? |\n| Modeling | Is the model fair to all groups? |\n| Deployment | Who benefits? Who's harmed? |\n| Monitoring | Are we detecting negative impacts? |\n\n## The Ethical Decision Framework\n\n```\n1. Identify stakeholders\n2. Consider potential harms\n3. Evaluate alternatives\n4. Seek diverse perspectives\n5. Document your reasoning\n6. Monitor outcomes\n```\n\n## Red Flags 🚩\n\n- Data collected without proper consent\n- Vulnerable populations disproportionately affected\n- No human oversight in critical decisions\n- Lack of transparency about how data is used\n\n> 🎯 **Principle:** Just because we CAN doesn't mean we SHOULD."

Representation Bias\nUnderrepresentation of certain groups in training data\n- Example: Medical AI trained mostly on white patients\n\n### 3. Measurement Bias\nThe way we measure things introduces bias\n- Example: Using arrest rates as proxy for crime rates\n\n### 4. Aggregation Bias\nOne-size-fits-all models that ignore group differences\n- Example: Diabetes prediction ignoring ethnic variations\n\n### 5. Evaluation Bias\nBiased benchmarks for testing models\n- Example: Facial recognition tested mainly on lighter faces\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\n| System | Bias | Consequence |\n|--------|------|-------------|\n| COMPAS | Racial | Higher false positives for Black defendants |\n| Amazon Hiring | Gender | Lower scores for women |\n| Healthcare | Racial | Black patients received less care |\n| Image Search | Stereotyping | Reinforced gender stereotypes |\n\n> ⚠️ **Warning:** Bias is often invisible until it causes harm—actively look for it!"
